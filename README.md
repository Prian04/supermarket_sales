# SuperMarket Sales

To provide comprehensive insights into supermarket sales and effectively address the defined problems, we have structured our analysis and visualizations around key performance indicators and strategic filtering. Below is an outline of the planned dashboard, including the SQL query execution and the Power BI visualizations:

### SQL Query Execution
Before creating the dashboard,  the data and problem points using SQL queries exexuted. The results were documented and captured in a Word document with screenshots of the return values for reference. i.e supermarket_query.docx

### Power BI Visualizations
**1)** **KPI** **Monitoring**

  - **Objective:** To gain insights into total sales by profit, quantity, sales, percentage tax, and payment methods.
   
  - **Filters Applied:**
   
    - Date Range: To analyze sales trends over specific periods.
     
    - Payment Method: To identify trends and preferences in payment methods.
     
    - Customer Type: To differentiate between sales from different customer segments.
     
  - **Description:** The KPI monitoring section will include various cards and gauges to display key metrics such as total sales, total profit, total quantity sold, percentage tax, and breakdown by payment 
      methods. These metrics will provide an at-a-glance overview of business performance.

**2)** **Column Chart:**

  - **Objective:** To visualize sales performance by gender and city branch.
  
  - **Description:** The column chart will present sales data differentiated by gender and city branches. This visualization will help stakeholders understand how different branches and customer demographics are performing, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

**3)** **Pie Chart**

  - **Objective:** To identify the most and least sold products.
  
  - **Description:** The pie chart will illustrate the proportion of sales attributed to each product. This will help the client identify top-selling products and those with lower sales. The insights gained can be used to strategize on improving the sales of underperforming products.

**4)** **Slicer**

  - **Objective:** To enable detailed data filtering for deeper insights.
  
  - **Filters Applied:**
  
    - Date Range: To narrow down sales data to specific time periods.
    
    - Payment Type: To filter sales based on different payment methods.
    
    - Customer Type: To segment sales data by customer types.
    
  - **Description:** Slicers will be utilized to allow users to dynamically filter the data and explore various dimensions. This interactivity will enable the client to drill down into specific aspects of sales, such as identifying the reasons behind high or low sales for certain products, and understanding customer preferences.

### Conclusion
By incorporating these visualizations into the Power BI dashboard, we will provide a comprehensive and interactive tool for monitoring and analyzing supermarket sales. The dashboard will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by offering clear and actionable insights into various aspects of their sales performance.
